## 🚀 Project Overview

"There Is No Website" is a quirky, interactive web experience that challenges the very notion of what a website should be. With a twist on the theme "Functionally Dysfunctional," we crafted an experience where things aren't quite what they seem. The user is drawn into an unconventional, physics-based web world where interactions defy expectations, blending the boundaries between functionality and dysfunctionality.

This project was created during the "Hackathon with Lewis" event held from August 9-16, 2024.
There is one surprise at the end! So do visit the live deployment to try out.

## 🌟 Inspiration

Inspired by the provided theme, we aimed to create a project that would challenge the traditional expectations of what a website should be. Instead of a typical, well-structured site, we built something that appears chaotic yet is still engaging and interactive, reflecting the theme in every aspect of the design and functionality.

## 🔧 Built With

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Matter.js**: To bring the physics engine to life with realistic interactions.
- **React**: For building the dynamic and interactive user interface.
